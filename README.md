# History Rabbit Hole

This small history website draws on the Numbers API and offers a list of historical events and where to go to find out more. The problem the site sets out to solve is that of not having a thread to pull on to unravel the sweater of history. The site provides snippets that you can find out more about on Wikipedia or at a nearby library.
